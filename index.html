                About
            </h1>  
            <p> Listen, trust me I know more than <strong>anyone</strong> that the world doesn't need another CSS framework. But, this isn't for the world. This for me. So with out further ado, I present to you .....</p>
            <div class="pretty container center">
                <div class="pretty text-logo biggest text">Pretty Please</div>
            </div>
            <h2>Why. Would you do this.</h2>
            <p>I started working with websites and the internet in 2018, and I pretty quickly learned I would rather go hunting through debugging logs for segfaults than ever touch a piece of CSS in my lifetime. But I realized something important just before my senior year of college.</p>
            <div class="pretty container center">
                <div class="pretty text-logo bigger text">I need money so I can eat.</div>
            </div>
            <p>Any way after panicking for a few house about various ways to starve myself, I realized the solution was to do what most upcoming college grads do and get a job. Well to get one of those you need a website, resumes are cool, but websites are cooler.</p>
            <p>Now naturally the first question I asked is how is my website going to look, what are the colors going to and falling down the rabbit hole I realized, I need to get into a fight with my old friend CSS. </p>
            <div class="pretty container center">
                <div class="pretty  bigger red bold text">Put a cartoon here</div>
            </div>
            <p>When I consulted my UI designer friends all of them said "Use a UI frame work. It'll be easy. You just copy and paste and it'll look great." </p>
            <p>Now heres the thing. I don't know about about most people, but I have a requirement for building stuff, I want to know why. I dont have it in me to do something with using something with out having at least a rudimentary explanation of how and why it works. So after attempting to use just about every framework under the sun. I decided it was time to go do this the "right way", by starting from scratch and writing my own!</p>
            <h1 id='getting-started'>Getting Started</h1>
            <p>
                To really get started all you need to do is include the a link to the css file as a link and it works. This will pull the latest version of pretty please into your project
            </p>
            <div class="pretty container center">
                <div class="pretty red bold big text">css link here</div>
            </div>
            <p>
                If you want I icons which I highly reccomend, because icons are <em>awesome,</em> you will also need font-awesome you can learn how to access that here: <text class="pretty red text">LINK<text>
            </p>

            <p> Or if you're lazy like me here's some boilerplate html code and copying and pasting this into to place will just work.</p>
            <div class="pretty container center">
                <div class="pretty red bold big text">Boiler plate</div>
            </div>
            <h1 id='features'>
                Features
            </h1> 
            <h2>Buttons</h2>
            <h2>Text</h2>
            <h2>Cards</h2>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <h2>Code</h2>
            <h2>Images</h2>
            <h2>Videos</h2>
            <h2>Menu</h2>
            <h2>Sidebar</h2>
            <h2>Dropdown</h2>
            <h2>Containers</h2>
            <h2>Grids</h2>
            <p>Just use CSS Grids man I'm not sitting down and imagining all of your various implementations strats: <text class="pretty red text">LINK<text><p>
